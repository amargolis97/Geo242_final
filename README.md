# Geo242_final
A repository of data used to complete the final project in GEO242, a graduate level geophysical course taught by Dr. Gareth Funning at UC Riverside in Fall of 2025

In this repository you'll find the original data file from USGS, and the Jupiter notebook script to run the code.
The code will map the earthquake's locations in gmt, do an inversion for the best fitting plane, and caculate strike and dip of the plane.
